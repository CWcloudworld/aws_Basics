## What is VPC

AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to create isolated virtual networks in the cloud. It enables users to define their own virtual network environment, including IP address ranges, subnets, routing tables, network gateways, and security settings.

Key features of AWS VPC include:

1. **Isolation**: VPCs provide isolation for resources deployed within them, allowing users to create multiple virtual networks with different configurations and security settings.

2. **Customization**: Users have full control over their VPC configuration, including defining IP address ranges, creating subnets, configuring routing tables, and setting up network access control lists (ACLs) and security groups.

3. **Connectivity**: VPCs can be connected to other VPCs, on-premises data centers, and external networks using various networking options, such as VPC peering, VPN connections, and AWS Direct Connect.

4. **Scalability**: VPCs can scale to accommodate a wide range of workloads, from small applications to large-scale enterprise deployments. Users can easily add or remove resources within their VPC as needed.

5. **Security**: AWS VPC provides security features such as network ACLs and security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to resources within the VPC. Users can define fine-grained access controls to restrict network access based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

Overall, AWS VPC provides a flexible and scalable networking solution for deploying and managing cloud-based applications and services, while allowing users to maintain control over their network environment and security posture.


1. **CIDR Block**:
   - CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing.
   - A CIDR block is a notation used to specify a range of IP addresses. It consists of an IP address and a prefix length, separated by a slash. For example, `192.168.0.0/16` represents the range of IP addresses from `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`.
   
2. **IP Address**:
   - An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
   - Public IP addresses are globally unique addresses assigned to devices directly accessible over the internet. Private IP addresses are used within a private network and are not directly accessible from the internet.
   
3. **Subnet**:
   - A subnet is a portion of a network that shares a common address component. It allows for the segmentation of a larger network into smaller, more manageable parts.
   - Private and public subnets are subnets configured with private and public IP addresses, respectively. Private subnets are typically used for resources that should not be directly accessible from the internet, while public subnets are used for resources that need to be accessible from the internet.

4. **AWS Internet Gateway**:
   - An AWS Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.
   - It enables outbound traffic from instances in the VPC to the internet and allows inbound traffic from the internet to instances in the VPC, subject to security group and network ACL rules.

5. **AWS NAT Gateway**:
   - An AWS NAT Gateway is a managed network address translation (NAT) service provided by AWS.
   - It allows instances in private subnets to initiate outbound traffic to the internet, while preventing inbound traffic initiated by the internet from reaching those instances.

6. **Route Tables**:
   - Route tables are used to determine where network traffic is directed within a VPC.
   - They contain rules, known as routes, that specify the destinations (CIDR blocks) and targets (internet gateway, NAT gateway, VPC peering connection, etc.) for network traffic leaving or entering the VPC.

7. **AWS NACL (Network Access Control List)**:
   - An AWS NACL is an optional layer of security for controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
   - It acts as a firewall and allows or denies traffic based on rules defined in the NACL. NACL rules can be set to allow or deny traffic based on IP addresses, protocols, and ports.

These are fundamental networking concepts in AWS that play crucial roles in configuring and securing your cloud infrastructure.
